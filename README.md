# DA_Exoplanets
# Description
This is one of my earliest projects, back from school. It uses a database containing detection data
of exoplantes, process it, and creates a series of visualizations. I have included the one that
I like the most: a picture of the sky, locating the exoplanets and coloring them according
to the respective detection type used in each of them. It also includes a very basic UI
for the users to input the route for the database and select which task to perform.
